Python app | Inventory Management Grocery4ALL
The retail company “Grocery4ALL” demands a new booking system that keeps track of their inventory, revenue, and costs regarding their business operations.
Now it’s your task to provide a system that is capable of handling the following tasks:
/
Create an inventory of products entailing ID, name, quantity, purchasing price, and selling price (10 different products should be a good starting point).
/
Show Inventory: Display the inventory containing all products.
/
New products: Add new products to the inventory.
/
Selling products: Sell products from the current inventory.
/
Re/stock products: Increase the stock of current products.
/
Show the last transactions.
/
Calculate the total revenue, total value of the inventory, total costs, and total profit.
Interaction:
/
Your program should ask the user what to do next. So whether a new product should be added, a given product should be restocked, or sold, or calculations should be provided.
•
Regarding calculations you should be able to choose between the total revenue, the total value of the inventory, the total profit, or the total costs.
•
Also the inventory value should be able to be displayed for specific product IDs.
•
Adding products, restocking products, and selling products are considered transactions.
•
Costs do occur whenever a transaction (add product, reorder product) is processed.
•
Revenue is generated whenever a product is sold.
•
Revenue & costs start with a value of 0 and are updated with every transaction.
